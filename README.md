# SunFeather
Website for a fictional Esport team. Made with pure HTML, CSS and JS

This was for a project in college, that's why the content is in spanish.

The every photo in the website, with the expection of the little feather in the title, was taken from Google, so I don't own any of that.

The news section and the tweets section are also fictional and jokes. It shouldn't be taken serious
